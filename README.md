## Project motivation: 
Project management is a practice as old as human culture. No matter the discipline, students cannot avoid project management. We found that lots of people have great project ideas, but are completely clueless about how to start a project, allowing their ideas to go to waste. We thus decided to create an app to help students/budding entrepreneurs get started and provide guidance for the process, using a proven project management framework developed by professors from Singaporeâ€™s leading university. As such, users can manage their project process more effectively and systematically
## Target group:
Students/budding entrepreneurs who have ideas and plan to start on real-world projects. 
## Product description and usage guide:
To create a web application which can help users construct their ideas, carry out and keep track of their project progress. 
This application consists of various features and four parts of content, namely a summary of the identified issue, cost management, task management and human resource management. These are main pillars of project management. 
### Login and Logout
For first time users, you can register an account using their email. 
After creating an account, you can proceed to login. 
At any point of the web app, you can click on Logout at top right corner to logout. 
### Side Navigation Bar
You can use the side navigation bar on the left to navigate the different sections of the app. 
### Summary 
For the summary, users are expected to indicate the issue identified, their solutions, stakeholders involved and expected outcome. This is to mark the scope of users' projects, help users to keep in mind of the aim of their projects and help and serve as a reminder for users to make decisions that align with the main aim of their projects.
### Cost Management 
This section is to help users manage their project cost and budget. Users can input their initial budget for the project and are able to update it along the way. It also consists of a cost table in which users can add in newly purchased items and delete outdated/wrong items. We are aware that many users might not be very clear of the unit cost of the items they want to purchase. Our app provides users with a database in which they can search for the unit cost of many items they are interested in. This is to help them plan and allocate project budgets better. The total cost of all items in the table will be calculated automatically. Based on the total budget and total cost, the amount of remaining budget will be calculated. This is to help users monitor their spendings and keep their spendings within their budget. 
### Time Management
This section is to help users monitor the entire progress of their projects and help them complete their projects on time. This section also consists of a time table in which users can add in or delete activities/tasks. These activities will be automatically arranged in chronological order to and a timeline will also be automatically generated to make activities more organised and help users visualise the sequence of their activities better.  
### Human Resource Management
This section contains a human resource table to record down relevant personnel involved in the project and making human resource management more organised.
